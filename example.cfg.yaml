# The algorithm used for selecting the network path.
# One of: weighted-lru, roundrobin, random, hash
algorithm: weighted-lru

# The address where the SOCKS5 server will listen for incoming connections.
# This should be in the format of IP:PORT.
listen: 127.0.0.1:1080

# If set to true, the port part of addr will be hashed when generating the address hash key.
hashport: true

# A list of network paths to use for routing traffic.
# Each path can be of type 'direct' or 'proxy'.
paths:
  # REPLACE THESE IP ADDRESSES WITH YOUR ACTUAL NETWORK ADAPTER IPs

  - type: direct # Direct connection through LAN/Ethernet
    addr: 192.168.1.100 # REPLACE: IP address of your Ethernet adapter

  - type: direct # Direct connection through WiFi
    addr: 192.168.1.101 # REPLACE: IP address of your WiFi adapter

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP:
# 1. Run 'ipconfig /all' on your main PC
# 2. Find your Ethernet adapter IPv4 address and replace 192.168.1.100
# 3. Find your Wireless LAN adapter IPv4 address and replace 192.168.1.101
# 4. Make sure both connections are active and working
# 5. Save this file as 'config.yaml'
